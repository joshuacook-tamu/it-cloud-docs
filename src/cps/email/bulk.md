# Bulk Communications

Texas A&M provides a variety of email services to communicate with large groups.  Each tool has its own audience and purpose. Email sent from these systems should comply with the guidelines set forth by Google and Yahoo outlined in the [FAQ](./faq.md).

## Bulk Mail

The Bulk Email Request System provides a convenient way to request an email distribution to a specific group of recipients within the Texas A&M University community.  All faculty, staff and students may opt-in to the list(s).  The Bulk Email service moved to Division of Marketing and Communication in June 2023. Requirements for sending email notifications through the Bulk Email Service at <https://bulkmail.tamu.edu/> can be found on the [Division of Marketing and Communication website](https://marcom.tamu.edu/resources/group-email/index.html).

Opt-in recipients to the lists can find more information in this [FAQ](https://itselfservice.tamu.edu/tamucs?id=tamucs_kb_article&sys_id=KB0010314).

## Emma

Emma is a mass email system used to communicate with campus members. Emma is managed by the Division of Marketing & Communications. A separate Emma system is managed by the Texas A&M Foundation to communicate with former students.
