# Bulk Communications

Texas A&M provides a variety of mechanisms to communicate with large groups.  Each tool has its own audience and purpose.

## Bulk Mail

The Bulk Email Request System provides a convenient way to request an email distribution to a specific group of recipients within the Texas A&M University community.  All faculty, staff and students may opt-in to the list(s).  The Bulk Email service moved to Division of Marketing and Communication in June 2023. Requirements for sending email notifications through the Bulk Email Service at <https://bulkmail.tamu.edu/> can be found on the [Division of Marketing and Communication website](https://marcom.tamu.edu/resources/group-email/index.html).

Opt-in recipients to the lists can find more information in this [FAQ](https://itselfservice.tamu.edu/tamucs?id=tamucs_kb_article&sys_id=KB0010314).

## Listserv

Listserv is a software package designed to create, maintain, and use email mailing lists. It allows someone to email a large number of individuals without manually entering every address for each email. At TAMU, Listserv is used to maximize efficiency of communication between students in a class, members of an organization, or a group of individuals.

TAMU Listserv can be accessed at <https://listserv.tamu.edu>.  For more information on TAMU Listserv see this [KB article](https://itselfservice.tamu.edu/tamucs?id=tamucs_kb_article&sys_id=KB0010339) or the [Listserv FAQ](https://itselfservice.tamu.edu/tamucs?id=tamucs_kb_article&sys_id=KB0010338).

## TAMUDirect

TAMUDirect is a service provided by Texas A&M Technology Services that automates the membership of certain Texas A&M Google Groups. TAMUDirect is used for course list and organization lists.  A course list is a mailing list created for one or more course sections to allow instructors to communicate to their classes.  Organization lists are used by colleges, departments, or divisions to automate mailing list inclusion for staff, faculty, and student lists or combinations thereof.

More information on TAMUDirect see these KB articles [TamuDirect - General Use](https://itselfservice.tamu.edu/tamucs?id=tamucs_kb_article&sys_id=KB0011697) and [TAMUDirect - FAQ](https://itselfservice.tamu.edu/tamucs?id=tamucs_kb_article&sys_id=KB0011857).
