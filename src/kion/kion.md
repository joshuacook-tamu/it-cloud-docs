# Kion

## What is Kion? 
---
Kion is a platform that bundles together various Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools with financial tracking and reporting across all three major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), and is designed to provide maximum visibility and ease-of-use for both customers and engineers within a “single pane of glass” portal. 



## Purpose of Kion 
---
This platform simplifies cloud security and cost management across multiple cloud environments (**AWS, Azure, GCP**). It helps you design and automatically enforce security standards (e.g., CIS, NIST, HIPAA), proactively identify and remediate security risks, and quickly fix configuration issues. The platform also tracks spending, identifies ways to save money, and offers tools to control cloud costs. This information can be presented as an aggregation of multiple accounts across multiple cloud service providers. This gives you better visibility and control over your cloud environments.


## Benefits 
---
This tool empowers professionals in multiple roles to manage cloud costs and security: 

- **Cloud Engineers, Architects, and Security Personnel**: Easily design and implement security measures that meet industry standards (like CIS, NIST, or HIPAA). Proactively prevent issues with fine-tuned controls over cloud services and user permissions. Quickly fix misconfigurations and other security concerns across multiple cloud environments, even setting up automatic fixes. 

- **FinOps Specialists**: Track spending and budgets in detail. Discover ways to save money by optimizing or removing unused cloud resources. Optionally set spending limits that automatically take action if costs get too high. 

- **Cloud Account Owners and Users**: Monitor your own spending and security compliance across all connected accounts. Manage user access and permissions. Respond to security issues and cost-saving suggestions. Simplify access to AWS, Azure, and GCP with a single interface. If needed, request temporary exemptions to security policies with clear justifications and risk management plans.
