## Accounts

Once a Cloud Service Provider account has been [requested and approved](https://it.tamu.edu/cloud/get-started/index.php), users may log into Kion at [kion.cloud.tamu.edu](https://kion.cloud.tamu.edu) by clicking the Microsoft Entra ID button and authenticating with their NetID. 

```admonish collapsible=true class="aggiecustom2" title="Kion Login Page"

No additional permissions are required to log into Kion, and any accounts that are owned by a user, or to which they have been given access, will automatically be made available for them to view.

## Navigation 

Once logged into Kion, you will be presented with a dashboard and a sidebar menu with several tabs. The key tab will be ‘Projects’. In Kion, a Project is a collection of accounts.
