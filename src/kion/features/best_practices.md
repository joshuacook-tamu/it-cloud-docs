## User Management

1. Don't attempt to create users in Kion. Users are created automatically when they log in for the first time.

2. When creating User Groups, please use the following naming convention: `<project>-<role>`. 
    
    For example, for the project `dit-cscn-aip-test-001`, if you're creating a User Group for regular users, you would name it or `dit-cscn-aip-test-001-users`.

2. Don't create Cloud Access Roles granting Administrator access to users. This is not necessary and can lead to security vulnerabilities - please practice the principle of least privilege.
    - As a default, only the user(s) who ***own*** the project have full administrative access to the accounts in a project.
